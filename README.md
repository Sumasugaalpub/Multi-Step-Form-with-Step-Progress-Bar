Multi-Step Form with Step Progress Bar using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
ðŸ“š Welcome!
This project demonstrates how to create a Multi-Step Form with a Step Progress Bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸš€ What is a Multi-Step Form?
A Multi-Step Form divides a long form into multiple steps, asking users to input details step by step. A Progress Bar is used to show users their progress and indicate how many steps are left.

âœ¨ Features:
No external libraries: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Step Progress Bar: Shows users their progress.
Navigation buttons: Next and Previous buttons to move through the steps.
4-step process: Each step contains user input fields.
ðŸ’» How It Works:
Step 1: User enters details.
Step 2-4: The user moves forward with the Next button or goes back using Previous.
Progress Bar: Updates as the user progresses through the steps.
Enjoy building your own Multi-Step Form! ðŸ˜Š
